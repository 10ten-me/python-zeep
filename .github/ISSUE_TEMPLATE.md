Thanks for taking the time to report an issue!

Since Zeep is a module I've created and currently maintain mostly in my spare
time I need as much information as possible to quickly analyze/fix issues.

Please provide the following information:

1. The version of zeep (or if you are running master the commit hash/date)
2. The WSDL you are using
3. An example script

Please see http://docs.python-zeep.org/en/master/reporting_bugs.html for 
more information.
